# PlacementPrepPortal



## Project Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2025
* **Today's Progress**: *Finalized the core features and data structure for the project. Chose the official name "Placement Prep Portal". Created the public GitHub repository with an MIT License, a .gitignore file, and set up the initial project log in the README.md.*

* **Thoughts**: *The project is well-defined, and the foundation is set. Having a clear plan and repository structure in place before writing code feels organized and professional.*

* **Next Steps**: *Create the UI wireframe/sketch for the main page (post list) and the "Add New Experience" form.*
